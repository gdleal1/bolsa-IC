The dataset is related to heart disease and contains various medical indicators. Each column represents:

1) age: Age of the individual.

2) cp: Chest pain type. This usually indicates:

    0: Typical angina
    1: Atypical angina
    2: Non-anginal pain
    3: Asymptomatic

3) trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) when the individual is admitted.

4) chol: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.

5) fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).

6) restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results. Possible values:

    0: Normal
    1: ST-T wave abnormality (likely sign of coronary artery disease)
    2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart muscle)

7) thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved during a test (typically during exercise).

8) exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).

9) oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (measures heart stress during exercise).

10) slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment. Possible values:

    0: Upsloping (likely to be healthy)
    1: Flat (intermediate risk)
    2: Downsloping (higher risk of heart issues)

11) ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy (a medical imaging technique to visualize blood vessels).

12) thal: Thalassemia blood disorder indicator:

    1: Normal
    2: Fixed defect (no proper blood flow in some part of the heart)
    3: Reversible defect (a problem with blood flow that can be improved)

13) target: The diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence of heart disease).

14) Column that represents gender (0 = female, 1 = male).
